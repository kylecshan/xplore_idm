# xplore_idm

This repository holds Kyle's code for his Fall 2019 Xplore project with IDM. Apologies for the mess.
You can see the final report in figures/writeup.pdf

The goal of the project is to use a CNN to extract features from Landsat 8 satellite imagery, which will then be used to predict healthcare outcomes. See the writeup for more details.

Data pre-processing is done in R.
Interfacing with Google Earth Engine to get satellite images is done in Jupyter notebooks run on Google Colab.
Modeling is done in local Jupyter notebooks/python code using Pytorch.
