# xplore_idm

This repository holds Kyle's code for his Fall 2019 Xplore project with IDM. 

The goal of the project is to use a CNN to extract features from Landsat 7 satellite imagery, which will then be used to predict healthcare outcomes.

Data pre-processing is done in R.
Interfacing with Google Earth Engine to get satellite images is done in Jupyter notebooks run on Google Colab.
Modeling is done in local Jupyter notebooks with Tensorflow.
